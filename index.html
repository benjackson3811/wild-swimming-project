        <!--Semantic Markup descriptions (take up)-->
        header: A container to be used for a web page header which typically contains the site logo, heading elements, and site navigation.
        footer: A container to be used for a web page footer which typically contains authorship, contact, and copyright information in addition to navigational links and a link back to the top of the web page.
        main: A high-level element used to contain all of the content that is unique to a single web page and not repeated across multiple web pages.
        nav: An element to contain blocks of site navigation links. This element is typically placed in the page header and footer, and may also be used in an aside (sidebar) element as well.
        section: The section element is used to mark off sections of a document, such as chapters or major sections of a long form post.
        aside: Use to identify content that is related to the main content on the page but not part of the primary flow of the document. For example, the aside element may contain a glossary definition of a term that appears in a blog post or it may contain advertisements related to the contents of the page.
        article: The article element is used to identify a block of content suitable for reuse and syndication in other settings, such as a blog post or technical article.
